Learning node.js
---
As an important development of js, node has been my part of interest on web development. I'm really curious about how a front end language can be applied to backend, and why larger scale sites like goupon have chosen node.

I will firstly go though an smalll introduction book and then start reading the official docs. The next step is to make a micro project, but I have figured out the subject yet.

I hope this learning experience can enforce my js skill as well. 

Ok, let's go and play!
